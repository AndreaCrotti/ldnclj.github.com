h1. The London Clojure Group

We are people who live in London and are interested in programming in Clojure.

Currently our main activity is a monthly dojo where we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that our day jobs may not allow (although our goal must be to bring the light of Clojure to our benighted workplaces).

The dojos are sometimes proceeded by lightning talks and we do intend to have more talk sessions soon.
