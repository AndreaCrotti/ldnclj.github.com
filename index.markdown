# The London Clojure Group

We are people who live in London and are interested in programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

Currently our mains activity are 2 [monthly dojos](dojos.html) where
we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that
our day jobs may not allow and talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?q=clojure).

## Talk to us

There is
[London Clojurians Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians)
where you discuss any projects you are working on or any events the user
group should be putting on.

You can also find us on [freenode irc](http://freenode.net/) on the
#ldnclj channel.
