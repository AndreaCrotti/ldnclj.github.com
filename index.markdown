# The London Clojure Group

We are people who live in London and are interested in programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

Currently our mains activity are 2 [monthly dojos](dojos.html) where
we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that
our day jobs may not allow and talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?q=clojure).

We also organise occasional lunches, hack days, reading groups,
sprints and other events.

If you have an idea of an event you'd like to organise let us know on
the mailing list or in person. We'll help you to put on the event. All
of our events and activities are covered by our
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) to make them friendly and
welcoming to everyone.

## Upcoming events

We maintain a calendar of London Clojurians events [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=otfrom.com_pkatmn3n1ff8l5bvls3cnc01mc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).
