# The London Clojure Group

We are people who live in London and are interested in programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

Currently our mains activity are 2 [monthly dojos](dojos.html) where
we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that
our day jobs may not allow and talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?q=clojure).
