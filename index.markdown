# The London Clojure Group

We are people who live in London and are interested in programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

Currently our main activities are 2 [monthly dojos](dojos.html) where
we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that
our day jobs may not allow and talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?q=clojure).

We also organise occasional lunches, hack days, reading groups,
sprints and other events.

If you have an idea of an event you'd like to organise let us know on
the mailing list or in person. We'll help you to put on the event. All
of our events and activities are covered by our
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) to make them friendly and
welcoming to everyone.

## Upcoming events

We maintain a calendar of London Clojurians events [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=otfrom.com_pkatmn3n1ff8l5bvls3cnc01mc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).

### Talks

We hold talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?sort_by=asc&q=clojure&location=&content=meetups)
on the first Tuesday of the month every month except January and December.

Our next talk at SkillsMatter on 3 March is from [Bodil Stokke](http://twitter.com/bodil) called
[ÂµKanren: Running the Little Things Backwards ](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7025-kanren-running-the-little-things-backwards).

### Dojos

We currently run two [dojos](dojos.html) per month, which are kindly
hosted by uSwitch and ThoughtWorks.

The dojo sign up pages and details will be announced closer to the
events on the
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians).

#### uSwitch Dojo

Dojos at uSwitch are on the second Monday of the month.

#### ThoughtWorks Dojo

Dojos at ThoughtWorks are on the last Tuesday of the month, except
December.

### Clojurian Lunches

Evening and weekend events don't work for everyone. So some people
have organised lunches near their workplaces.

#### City of London Clojurian Lunch

The monthly London Clojurian City of London Lunches are held on the
4th Wednesday of the month. There are more details on the
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians).

### Yearly Conference

Tickets are already available for our yearly London Conference at
Skills Matter. You can find out more on the
[2015 Clojure eXchange page](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6861-clojure-exchange-2015).

The Call for Presentations will be announced in the Summer.

## Talk to us

There is
[London Clojurians Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians)

group should be putting on.
