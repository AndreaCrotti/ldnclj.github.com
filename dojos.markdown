# Clojure Dojos

The dojos are based around ongoing piece of work that is built on month by month. The implementation is via pair programming and the pair's laptop is projected for everyone to follow what's going on.

## FAQ

### How much Clojure do I need to know before I come to a dojo?

None. Really, it's about learning. The first one you go to may be baffling but you are going to see real people working with real code and that is going to be much more helpful that slogging your way through another chapter of a book.

### Do I have to have a go the first time I come to a dojo?

While it would be great to have a Fight Club-esque rule, it's not necessary. However it's not as scary as it seems and it can be empowering to just launch yourself into it. Rather like jumping into a pool rather than inching your way in.

On a practical note the best slot to take if you want to build your confidence is the last co-pilot of the night as you'll get to talk to the pilot but not actually have to code yourself.

### Why can't we talk during a dojo round?

Because the coding pair are doing a really hard thing and keeping quiet is a way of having some respect for that effort they are putting in. It can also be really distracting. There is usually a mixing session before the dojo and a stop at the pub at the end so there's still plenty of time to talk to people.

### When we're coding why do we have to talk?

Because people are interested in the thought-processes you are going through to solve the problem. It is particularly helpful for beginners to see how more advanced coders break down a big problems into more soluble parts.

### Why do you use tests and TDD?

If you are working on your own code in a functional style then you may not really need much in the way of testing. If you only work on a codebase once a month and then when you do ten different people work on it in often different styles you really need some tests to try and make sure that your functionality is still consistent.

### Why can't we work on the code and checkin between sessions?

Because dojos are about learning and more specifically collective learning, changes should made by the group so the group have the chance to ask questions about those changes. You are free to discuss the dojo on the mail list and to fork the code and experiment on your own. Remember this isn't about your l33t skills with Clojure, it is about making all of us better Clojure coders.
