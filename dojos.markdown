# Clojure Dojos

We currently have two monthly dojos, which are practical events, in
London. You can find out more details on the
[London Clojurians Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/london-clojurians).

The purpose of the dojos is to have fun, meet new people, see old
friends and learn some clojure along the way.

## FAQ

### How much Clojure do I need to know before I come to a dojo?

None. Really, it's about learning. The first one you go to may be
baffling but you are going to see real people working with real code
and that is going to be much more helpful that slogging your way
through another chapter of a book.

### What is going to a dojo like?

Dojos are practical and fun sessions. We tend to break into small
teams of people and work on problems we've chosen that evening, though
sometimes someone will prepare something special.

By the end of the evening you should have written at least one line of
code even if it is ```(println "Hello world!")```.

According to this
[blog post](https://otfrom.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/how-to-run-a-london-clojure-dojo-in-20ish-easy-steps/),
most London Clojure Dojos are something like this:

* When you arrive at the dojo there should be a group of friendly
  welcoming people who are into clojure already or curious about
  clojure. Asking people about clojure and why they are interested in
  it is a great ice breaker question if you've not been before.

* Sometimes there are drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and
  food of some sort, but it isn't essential.

* There might be a white board where people write down ideas for the
  evening. Usually there is a group of beginners as well who might
  want to do something like work through problems on
  [4 clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/). There is usually a mixed
  group of experience, so you can usually find a group or activity
  that will be fun.

* You should have about an hour, or a bit more to work with your team
  on your chosen task for the evening.

* After that, there is show and tell, where you can share what you
  learned with everyone else. Even saying that you had trouble getting
  things going is useful as then we can all learn where the difficult
  bits of the language and the environment are.

* Don't forget to post your code to github. So that your team can see
  what you worked on.

* Then we clean up to make things easier for our hosts and go to the
  pub or go home.

* In between dojos, we usually discuss what we did in the dojo on the
  [London Clojurians Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/london-clojurians).
